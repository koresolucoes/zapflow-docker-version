-- This is a placeholder file for your Supabase database schema.
-- The README mentions a setup.sql file is needed to set up the database.
-- You should export your database schema from Supabase and place it here.
--
-- To get the schema, you can use the Supabase CLI:
-- 1. Link your project: `supabase link --project-ref <your-project-id>`
-- 2. Dump the schema: `supabase db dump -f supabase/setup.sql`
--
-- Or, you can generate it from the Supabase Dashboard's SQL Editor.
--
-- This file should contain all the CREATE TABLE, CREATE FUNCTION,
-- and RLS policies required for the application to run.
